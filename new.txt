Understand the porject and do these changes.

1. Initially before the Metric management system home page there should be a temporary page which has these properties:
  a. It should have the title "Onboard Data Product" and a subtitle "Dataset viewer". Here i have the ability to upload a dataset. At the right top corner there should be a button named "Convert to metric".
   b. If the "Convert to metric" is clicked then the Metric management system is opened. Rest all the things in the origianl porject are almost similar.

2. For the main project do these things:
  a. In the create new metric page of user login remove the upload dataset option.
  b. For the metric contract change the fields required into these:
     A. Remove the status option from the contract and use this status only after the metric is created or already available metric, to show whether or not they are approved, pending.

c. Remove the human editable version field in the metric contract and make it automatically showup in the overview of the metric once it is create.example: when a new metric is created it is default version 1, and if a exisiting metric is edited it becomes version 2 and so on automatically.
d. For each subsection of the metric contract include a small "i" icon which the user can hover over and it gives the description about the field to the user.
e. The column names of dataset uploaded in the first page of onboard data product should be available to see in the metric contract page.
